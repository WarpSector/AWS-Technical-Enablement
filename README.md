# ☁️ AWS Enterprise Enablement

> **A Docs-as-Code approach to technical training and cloud enablement.**



## 🎯 Project Overview
In modern enterprise environments, technical documentation and training curriculums often become outdated the moment they are published to a static PDF. 

**This repository serves as a live, version-controlled enterprise knowledge base**.

Treating technical enablement pipelines as software (*Docs-as-Code*), this technical documentation architecture ensures that training materials for Support, Sales, and Engineering teams remain `accurate`, `scalable`, and `highly available`.
<br><br/>

## 🛠️ The Architecture
This project was constructed using standard developer tooling to integrate seamlessly into a CI/CD pipeline environment:
* **Markdown:** For clean, responsive, and standardized text rendering across all devices.
* **Mermaid.js:** For programmatic, code-based data visualization and architectural topology mapping (meaning diagrams can be updated via pull requests rather than graphic design software).
* **Git/GitHub:** For version control, peer review, and continuous curriculum deployment.

## 📊 Curriculum Deployment Status

### 🟢 Production Deployed: AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02)
A fully operational, foundational curriculum designed to upskill non-technical staff on core AWS infrastructure, security, networking, and FinOps.

### 🚧 Active Build Pipeline: AWS AI Practitioner (AIF-C01)
Currently in active development. This module focuses on the operationalization of Artificial Intelligence, including Deep Learning architectures, Foundation Models, and MLOps deployment strategies.

## 🤖 Tooling & AI Transparency
The core documentation, notes, and information architecture/structure detailed in this repo are my original work. This repo reflects my personal approach to technical instructional design. To construct this repo efficiently, I partnered with AI as a technical pair-programmer to refine the Markdown syntax, format the data matrices, and generate the boilerplate Mermaid.js data visualizations.
