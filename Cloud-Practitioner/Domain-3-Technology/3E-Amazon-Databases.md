## Relational Databases vs. Non-Relational Databases
  * #### Relational Databases
    * Organized by tables and rows.
    * Has a rigid schema (MySQL).
    * Typically scaled vertically.
    * Supports complex queries and joins.
    * **Examples:** Amazon RDS, MySQL, PostgresSQL, Oracle, IBM DB2.
  * #### Non-Relational Databases
    * Varied data storage models.
    * Flexible schema (NoSQL) - data is stored in **key-value pairs**, columns, documents, graphs, and has varied or missing attributes.
    * Scales horizontally.
    * Unstructured, simple language that supports any kind of schema.
    * **Examples:** Amazon DynamoDB, MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j.
