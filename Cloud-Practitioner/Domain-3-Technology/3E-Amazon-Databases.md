## Types of Databases
  * #### Relational Databases
    * Organized by tables and rows.
    * Has a rigid schema (MySQL).
      * SQL is used to define the structure of the data and its elements.
      * SQL provides the tools to insert, update, delete, and querying data within the database table.
    * Typically scaled vertically.
    * Supports complex queries and joins.
    * **Examples:** Amazon RDS, MySQL, PostgresSQL, Oracle, IBM DB2.
  * #### Non-Relational Databases
    * Varied data storage models.
    * Flexible schema (NoSQL).
      * Data is stored in **key-value pairs**, columns, documents, or graphs.
      * There is no rigid schema so attributes can be missing or have different data types.
    * Scales horizontally.
    * Unstructured, simple language that supports any kind of schema.
    * **Examples:** Amazon DynamoDB, MongoDB, Redis, Neo4j.
  * #### Graph Databases
    * Designed to store, manage, and navigate relationships in data (e.g., Facebook).
    * Graph databases use:
      * Nodes to represent entities.
      * Edges to represent relationships.
      * Properties to store information about nodes and edges.
    * **Example:** Amazon Neptune.
