# Domain 4: Billing and Pricing
# (4A: Accounts, Billing, Pricing, and Support Tiers)

## Types of Pricing
  * ### Pay-as-you-Go
    * Easily adapts to business needs.
    * Adaption is based on needs, not forecasts.
    * Improved responsiveness to change.
    * Reduces risk of overpositioning of missing capacity.
  * ### Save when you Reserve
    * Invest in reserved capacity for 75% discount over the pay-as-you-go model.
    * The more you pay upfront, the greater the discount.   
  * ### Pay Less by Using More
    * Pay less using volume based discounts.
    * Tiered pricing means the more you use, the lower the unit pricing.
